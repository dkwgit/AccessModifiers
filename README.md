# AccessModifiers

Execute `dotnet build` in solution directory to see the error.

The code is one level deeper at [https://github.com/dkwgit/AccessModifiers/blob/master/AccessModifiers/Program.cs](https://github.com/dkwgit/AccessModifiers/blob/master/AccessModifiers/Program.cs).

I just put a class implementation and an interface in Program.cs (with the new top level approach, so 0 boilerplate--though its presence or absence is irrelevant).
